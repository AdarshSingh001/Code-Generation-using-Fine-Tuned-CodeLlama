# Fine-Tuning CodeLlama for UI Code Generation

This project involves fine-tuning the CodeLlama model to generate UI component code based on natural language prompts. The fine-tuned model can assist developers by providing accurate code snippets for various UI elements, streamlining the UI development process.

## Features

- **Custom Dataset**: The model was fine-tuned on a specialized dataset tailored for UI code generation.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Through iterative fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization, the code generation accuracy was improved by 20%.
- **Web-Based IDE Integration**: The model is integrated with a web-based IDE, allowing real-time code generation and editing.

## Installation

To replicate the fine-tuning process:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdarshSingh001/Fine_Tuning_codellama.git
    cd Fine_Tuning_codellama
    ```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the fine-tuning script:
    ```bash
    python fine_tune_codellama.py
    ```

## Usage

After fine-tuning, the model can be used within the web-based IDE to generate and edit UI code snippets. Refer to the provided Jupyter notebook for detailed instructions on how to use the model.
